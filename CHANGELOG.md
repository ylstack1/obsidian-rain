## [Unreleased]

## [1.7.1] - 2025-05-27

### Added
- **Fetch Modal**: Collections can now be selected from a dynamic, filterable list populated from the user's Raindrop.io account, in addition to manual ID/name entry.
- Contextual help links (`(?)`) next to complex settings in the Settings page (API Token, Filename Template) and Fetch Modal (Tag Match Type) linking to documentation.
- "Reset to Default" buttons in the Settings page for the main Default Template and for each content-type specific template.

### Changed
- Improved layout for input fields in Modals (Quick Import, Fetch Raindrops) and template text areas in Settings page, stacking them below descriptions for better readability and editing space.
- Enhanced user guidance in Quick Import modal with clearer instructions on how to find Raindrop item URLs/IDs.

### Fixed
- Corrected an issue in the Quick Import modal where Raindrop item IDs were not being parsed correctly from URLs or direct numeric input.
- Resolved a CI build failure by ensuring the `scripts` directory (containing `esbuild.config.mjs`) is included in the Git repository and not ignored by `.gitignore`.

## [1.7.0] - 2025-05-26

### Added

- **All-New Template System**: Introduced a powerful and flexible template system for complete control over note structure and content.
    - Includes a default template and pre-filled, customizable templates for each Raindrop type (Link, Article, Image, Video, Document, Audio).
    - Settings UI to enable/disable the template system, edit the default template, and manage individual content-type templates with toggles.
    - Modal options during fetch to temporarily override template settings (e.g., force default template).
- **Pre-calculated Template Variables**: Added new variables like `formattedCreatedDate`, `formattedUpdatedDate`, `renderedType`, `domain`, and `formattedTags` for easier template customization.
- **Directory Creation**: Implemented logic in `processRaindrop` to automatically create necessary target directories before writing note files, preventing "ENOENT: no such file or directory" errors.

### Changed

- **Default Templates Updated**: All built-in templates now use new variables, a flattened collection data structure (`collectionId`, `collectionTitle`, `collectionPath`, `collectionParentId`), and consistent `lastupdate` and `id` fields.
- **Template Data Structure**: Standardized variable names (e.g., `lastupdate`) and flattened collection data for easier use in templates.
- **Fallback Note Generation**: Improved formatting for notes created when the template system is disabled, ensuring correct use of `lastupdate` and newline characters.
- **README.md "Created Note Structure"**: Updated to show rendered Markdown output from the default template, providing a clearer example.
- **Dependencies**: Corrected `package.json` by removing an erroneous `@types/obsidian` devDependency.

### Fixed

- **Type Filtering in Modal**: Ensured selected type filter in the modal is correctly applied.
- **Collection Hierarchy Replication**: Correctly replicates Raindrop.io collection/sub-collection hierarchy as folders in Obsidian.
- **Frontmatter Rendering**: Resolved issues with `collection` field rendering as JSON by flattening data.
- **Template Helper Rendering**: Ensured pre-calculated variables render correctly in the "Details" section of notes.
- **Fallback Note Body Formatting**: Corrected an issue with literal `\\n` characters in fallback notes.

### Documentation

- Updated `docs/template-system.md` and `docs/template-gallery.md` to reflect the new template variables and structure, including the mandatory `id: {{id}}` field.
- Verified `docs/templates.md` (variable lists) and `docs/note-structure.md` (fallback structure) are consistent.
